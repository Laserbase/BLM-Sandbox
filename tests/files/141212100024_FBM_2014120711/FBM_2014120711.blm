The site lies to the north-eastern edge of the village although it is outside of the defined settlement boundary for West Row and is classified as Grade 2 agricultural land, currently in arable use. In terms of planning policy, this is regarded as countryside where residential development would be contrary to Saved Local Plan Policy 9.1, which requires a justification for new development within the rural area. However, any development proposal must be considered against the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) that was published in March 2012. &nbsp;Forest Heath District Council is unable to demonstrate a five-year housing land supply (present supply is 3.4 years) and as such, in accordance with paragraph 49 of the NPPF, relevant development plan policies cannot be considered up-todate.&nbsp;<br />The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment(SHLAA) 2012 Review identifies part of the land under reference WR/06 as accommodating between 17  22 dwellings on approximately 0.43 hectares and that this land could be developed within 1-5 years.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><br /><br />Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. <br /> The Agent has not tested any apparatus, equipment, fixtures and fittings or services and so cannot verify that they are in working order or fit for the purpose.
